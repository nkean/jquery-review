jquery (client side code), DOM manipulation

DOM: Document Object Model (view at a given point in time, RIGHT NOW)

$(document) is a function, .ready() is a method of that, function() is being passed into .ready method
.ready() is a callback function (it waits for the document to be ready before running) code in this script is running asyncronously
javascript runs right away because it is loaded in the head of the HTML file
$() is a selector, selects an element
$ could be replaced with jQuery, they both act the same

jQuery is very good at event handling (scrolls, clicks, text input, hovers, exiting, etc.)

descendent selectors: .deleteButton is descendent of listOfNames
